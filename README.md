# ZNE Quantum Circuit Noise Mitigation

## Overview
Explore noise mitigation in quantum circuits using Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) techniques. This repository provides tools to mitigate noise in quantum circuits, employing depolarizing noise models, unitary folding methods, and various extrapolation techniques for enhanced fidelity and reliability.

## Installation
- Clone this repository:
https://github.com/albertojromerot/ZNE-Quantum-Circuit-Noise-Mitigation.git

- Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
- Use `noise_model.py` to implement depolarizing noise models.
- Generate quantum circuits with `quantum_circuits.py`.
- Apply unitary folding with `unitary_folding.py`.
- Explore different extrapolation methods in `extrapolation_methods.py`.
- Compare mitigated and unmitigated results with `comparison.py`.

## Documentation
- Detailed explanations of the ZNE technique, noise mitigation methods, and extrapolation techniques are provided within the code files.
